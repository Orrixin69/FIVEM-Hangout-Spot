# rotational-hangout

This is a simple script which is a Hangout Spot. There is 10 configured spots which change every 15 mins IRL.

I made this as a way to get some of my players together instead of just staying at Legion Square.

Steps to install

- Download file
- Remove Main from FIVEM-Hangout-Spot
- edit client / server files if you wish to change anything sucha as blips etc
